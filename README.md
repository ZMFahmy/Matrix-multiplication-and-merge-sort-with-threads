Attatched in the file of each algorithm is the main.cpp file, which is to be compiled in the linux terminal first using the following command:

#### g++ main.cpp -o executable_file_name

ps: executable_file_name could be any name.

After that, the newly created executable file is run using the following command:

#### ./executable_file_name input_file

ps: input_file is the file_name.txt passed as argument to the program as input. Each algorithm file contains some sample input examples that could be uesd.

### Matrix multiplicaton
Implements matrix multiplication through two different approaches:
* every element in the output matrix is generated by a separate thread.
* every row in the output matrix is generated by a separate thread.
The runtime of both approaches is calculated, so that user could compare between them.

### Merge-sort
Each time the list is divided, two threads are created to do merge-sort on each half separately. This step is repeated recursively until each sub-list has only one element.
